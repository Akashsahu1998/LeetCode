# Problems

A collection of solutions of different Problems of every level, or the problems from Contests or the Monthly Challenges which are solved by me at LeetCode in CPP language.
In this LeetCode Repository, I am trying to put the codes of all LeetCode Problems that are solved by me.


## Structure of the Folder

- The Repository contains subfolders with the name of the Problems which are asked in Contest, Monthly Challenges, or the normal Problems of every level, which are solved by me at LeetCode.
- Inside each subfolder, some subfolders are added with respect to their parent folder, and these subfolders contain the solutions to the problems of that specific subfolder which are given at LeetCode. 

Examples: 
1) LeetCode / Contest / Weekly Contest 209 / 01 - Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X.cpp 
2) LeetCode / Contest / Easy / 595 - Big Countries.cpp
and so on.


Thank you.
