# Monthly Challenges

A collection of solutions of different Monthly Challenges given by me at LeetCode in CPP language.
In this Monthly Challenges folder, I am trying to put the codes of all my Monthly Challenges, which I am giving on LeetCode.


## Structure of the Folder

- The folder contains subfolders with the name of the month's challenges which are given by me at LeetCode.
- Inside each subfolder, solutions to the problems of that specific month are given.

Examples: 
1) Monthly Challenges / August-LeetCoding-Challenge-2020 / 01 Day - Detect Capital.cpp
2) Monthly Challenges / September-LeetCoding-Challenge-2020 / 01 Day - Largest Time for Given Digits.cpp
and so on...


Thank you.
